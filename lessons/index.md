Excited as you might be after following the [excellent jsonnet.org tutorial](https://jsonnet.org/learning/tutorial.html),
it can still be daunting to actually use Jsonnet in the real world. Instead of working
with arbitrary examples like cocktails or your favorite pets, these training materials
contain real worlds examples (good and bad) in the hope to lower the bar of entry.

> Note: A lot of the examples will be around Kubernetes objects, but don't worry if you
> don't know how Kubernetes works, this is not a requirement for understanding the Jsonnet
> examples.
