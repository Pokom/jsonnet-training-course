# Jsonnet Training Materials

Exciting as you might be after following the [excellent jsonnet.org tutorial](https://jsonnet.org/learning/tutorial.html),
it can still be daunting to actually use Jsonnet in the real world. Instead of working
with arbitrary examples like cocktails or your favorite pets, these training materials
contain real worlds examples (good and bad) in the hope to lower the bar of entry.

Common questions:

What are the lessons weâ€™ve learned after using jsonnet for years?
Why jsonnet? What benefit do we gain from it?
Why is it worth the inconvenience of people having to learn a new language/paradigm?
Why we use jsonnet (vs other solutions/tools)?
Tools/tricks when writing/debugging jsonnet?
What are some GrafanaLabs jsonnet idioms that we try to use?
